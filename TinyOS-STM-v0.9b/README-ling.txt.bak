The uart component and its driver are added.You can use uart component to debug your program.

To learn how to use uart component, you can run UsartSerialTest app.
$ cd ~/\TinyOS-STM-v0.9b\apps\UsartSerialTest
$ make emote.

If you have your own tinyos, you can followe the steps below.

1. copy ~\TinyOS-STM-v0.9b\tos\chips\stm32\usb-serial to the corresponding dir of your tinyos.
2. make revision to HplSTM32InterruptM.nc(comment USART1_IRQHandler(). Tis funtion is redefined in uart component)
3. make revision to ~\TinyOS-STM-v0.9b\tos\platforms\emote\tos.x(add compiler path)
4. cope ~\TinyOS-STM-v0.9b\apps\UsartSerialTest to your corresponding dir.
$ cd ~/\TinyOS-STM-v0.9b\apps\UsartSerialTest
$ make emote.

Note: only the uart component is tested.
